# VariantCallerByDJREDDY


VariantCaller ** is a Python tool for identifying and annotating genetic variants in real-time using a combination of machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and bioinformatics databases. The tool can handle large datasets and provide accurate variant calls with high sensitivity and specificity.
Getting Started
To get started with VariantCaller, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. VariantCaller requires Python 3.6 or later.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VariantCaller.git
cd VariantCaller
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
VariantCaller can be run using the command line. To preprocess the data, use the following command:
python preprocess.py --input input.fastq --output output.bam --reference reference.fasta
This will preprocess the raw sequencing data by removing low-quality reads, trimming the reads, and aligning the reads to the reference genome.
To identify genetic variants, use the following command:
python variant_calling.py --input input.bam --output output.vcf --algorithm GATK --database dbSNP
This will identify genetic variants using the GATK algorithm and annotate the variants using the dbSNP database.
